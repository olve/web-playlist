# web-playlist
client-side music-player webapp

demo at http://nana.io/music

todo: convert the [v2 podcast/audiobook player](https://github.com/olve/web-playlist/tree/es6) to boilerplate code.
It was abandoned because pocketcasts can play local files, but there is some all right webpack/serviceworker/indexed-db code there.
